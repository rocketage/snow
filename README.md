# jQuery snowfall plugin

Creates a snow effect on the site. See the demo html file for usage.

Makes a nice effect and the settings options give a fair amount of tweakage.

Should really be implemented using CSS3 animations to provide hardware acceleration but programming in javascript is way more fun :-)
Due to this your milage may vary (looks bit less smooth on mobile)

Maybe one day I'll convert it...
